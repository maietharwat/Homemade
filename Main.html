                        </h2>
                        <p class="bodyoftext2"> Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring polysaccharide found in the human body. It acts as a cushioning and lubrication agent for our joints, nerves, hair, skin, and eyes. When used in skincare, it acts as a moisture binder, which means that it will attach itself to the water in the cells (while also attracting and holding water from the air) making them plump.
For just-as-effective results (and far less money), try our serums well-reviewed option. It's a blend of accelerated Retinol SA, an ingredient that works to fade crow's-feet and forehead and cheek wrinkles, as well as brighten your skin's tone and enhance its texture. Plus, it incorporates hyaluronic acid to plump and hydrate, replenishing moisture in your skin and soothing any irritation from the actives. </p>

                       </h2>
                        <p class="bodyoftext">Another anti-aging, anti-acne goodie, IS FACE Active Serum also adds brightening to the equation—making it pretty much a one-stop-shop for all skincare woes. Over time, it buffs away fine lines, reduces redness and breakouts, and even works on stubborn scars. Lindsey Metrus, our senior editor, is also a fan. She gushes, "Using a serum that's a one-two punch in terms of hydration and skin clarification is just about all I could want in a formula, and this cult-loved variation from IS FACE delivers just that. Not only does my skin look dewy and fresh after repeated use, but it also keeps my breakouts at bay, especially when my cycle rolls around."</p>
